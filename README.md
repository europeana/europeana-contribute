Europeana Stories is a storytelling platform enabling members of the public
to contribute their stories about European cultural heritage to
[Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/).


## Requirements

* Ruby 2.4.2 & Bundler
* MongoDB
* S3 object storage


## Getting started

For non-production environments, you may use the supplied Docker configuration
to get started:

```shell
bundle exec ./docker/setup
docker-compose up
```

Docker will now be running three containers:
* `minio` for S3 object storage at `localhost:3001`, including a web UI at
  http://localhost:3001/
* `mongodb` for metadata storage at `localhost:3002`
* `redis` for enqueuing sidekiq jobs at `localhost:3003`

Your S3 access and secret keys along with other S3 configuration will have been
written to the files `.env.development` and `.env.test`. Uploaded files will
be stored in `tmp/minio`.

Install the gem bundle:
```shell
bundle install
```

Create MongoDB indexes, and seed:
```shell
bundle exec rake db:mongoid:create_indexes
bundle exec rake db:seed
```

Create an admin user:
```
bundle exec rake user:create EMAIL=your.name@example.org PASSWORD=secret
```

Start the web server and a sidekiq instance using foreman:
```shell
bundle exec foreman start
```

Now Europeana Stories will be accessible at http://localhost:5000/ and its
admin interface at http://localhost:5000/admin

If no other port is specified, port 5000 is set as the default by foreman initialization. To change the port simply add another PORT to your .env file.
```
#.env
PORT=3000
```
